There are many factors that can lead to poor air quality, but the two most common are related to elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone or particulate matter.  Ground level ozone forms when nitrogen oxides from sources like vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions react with organic compounds in the presence of heat and sunlight. Per EPA, ozone can cause a number of health problems, including coughing, breathing difficulty, and lung damage. Exposure to ozone can make the lungs more susceptible to infection, aggravate lung diseases, increase the frequency of asthma attacks, and increase the risk of early death from heart or lung disease (see  https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=pubs.aqiguideozone ).  Particulate matter in the air consists of solid and liquid particles including smoke, dust and other aerosols, some of which are directly emitted and others are resulting from chemical transformations., The sources of these particles are numerous- including vehicles, factories, power plants, fires, other natural phenomena and human activities. Particle pollution is linked to a number of health problems, including coughing, wheezing, reduced lung function, asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes and even early death (see  https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=pubs.aqguidepart ).  The weather can have a significant impact on air quality since different aspects of the weather affect the amounts of ozone and particulates that are present in a specific area. Sunshine, rain, higher temperatures, wind speed, air turbulence, and mixing depths all affect pollutant concentrations.    Sunshine can cause some pollutants to undergo chemical reactions, resulting in the development of smog    Higher air temperatures can speed up chemical reactions in the air    Rain typically results in less pollution since it washes away particulate matter and can also wash out pollutants that are dissolvable    Wind speed, air turbulence, and mixing depth all affect how pollutants disperse, or spread out from an area      National Weather Service provides model forecast guidance for ozone, dust and fine particulate matter twice daily and smoke predictions once daily for next 48 hours. State and local agencies use NWS model guidance to issue air quality forecasts that weather forecast offices (WFOs) help disseminate. Air quality forecasts of unhealthy (code orange) or worse air quality that are shared with WFOs get displayed on NWS warning maps as air quality alerts. When Air Quality Alerts are in effect, there are many actions you can take to stay safe and protect your health.     Stay informed about air quality conditions in your area.Information is provided by EPA, NWS and the media    Choose a less-strenuous activity    Shorten and take more breaks during outdoor activity    Reschedule activities to the morning or to another day    Move your activity inside where ozone levels are usually lower    Spend less time near busy roads      If you would like to help reduce air pollution, you can take the following measures:      Eliminate tobacco smoke    Reduce your use of wood stoves and fireplaces    Dont burn candles, leaves, garbage, plastic or rubber    Use HEPA air filters and air cleaners designed to reduce particles    Drive less: carpool, use public transportation, bike or walk    Keep car, boat and other engines tuned    Inflate tires to the recommended pressure    When refueling: stop when the pump shuts off, avoid spilling fuel, and tighten your gas cap    Use low-VOC paint and cleaning products, and seal and store them so they cant evaporate    Choose energy saving appliances    Set thermostats higher in summer and lower in winter    Turn off lights you are not using      ( https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=pubs.aqiguideozone ) and ( https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=pubs.aqguidepart )  EPA compiles the official air quality forecasts at  https://www.airnow.gov/  and NWS provides hour-by-hour predictions of air quality at  https://airquality.weather.gov/ .        end of <div class=partial-width-borderbottom>    <div class=full-width-border>     area for features, frontpage thumbs, and custom page    end of <div class=partial-width-borderbottom feature-block>       <div class=center-content>    end of <div class=center>    sitemap area     end of <div class=footer>    legal footer area           US Dept of Commerce  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  National Weather Service                         Weather-Ready Nation 1325 East West Highway Silver Spring, MD 20910 Comments?

What You Can Do to Help Improve Air Quality                Improving Air Quality     One person can make a difference in Missouris air quality. Reducing the amount of dangerous emissions from vehicles benefits our outdoor air. You can safeguard Missouris air quality by taking the following steps.  Drive your car less.  Instead of driving every day to work, try carpooling, bicycling,using public transportation or walk, if possible.  Reduce gas consumption.  Plan ahead and consolidate errands and trips to reduce the amount of miles driven. When purchasing a new vehicle, consider vehicles that run efficiently and provide the best gas mileage.  Keep your car in good repair. Maintain your vehicles emissions control systems. The check engine light may indicate a problem with your vehicles emissions control system resulting in higher emissions and lower performance. Also, be sure to keepyour tires inflated to the suggested amount.  Turn off your engine.  An idling vehicle creates air pollution. Turn off your engine while waiting in drive-through lines and especially school or daycare drop-off zones.  Stopat the click.  When filling your vehicles fuel tank, stop at the click to avoid releasing dangerous fumes.  Fuel your vehicle in early or late hours.  In the heat of the summer, it helps reduce air pollution if vehicles are refueled in the early or late hours of the day rather than mid-day with the temperatures are the highest.  Dont burn your trash.  Burning your household trash can affect air pollution. Learn more by reading the Open Burning information below.  Plant and care for trees.  Trees filter pollutants and absorb carbon dioxide. Trees also release oxygen into the atmosphere and help cool our homes.  Open Burning Waste     Fall is often considered burn season because many communities schedule certain time periods to be the time for open burning. Open burning is the burning of any materials in which air contaminants are emitted directly into the air without first passing through a stack or chimney.  Did you know that in addition to posing a fire hazard during times of drought, the open burning of one households trash releases dangerous pollutants in higher levels than burning the trash of thousands of homes by a municipal waste incinerator? The open burning of certain trade wastes and tires also produces toxic emissions harmful to human health; therefore, the open burning of these types of wastes is strictly prohibited.  Burning trash in barrels and woodstoves creates a low temperature fire. More smoke is produced and more toxic air pollutants are released in low temperature fires. Smoke can cause eye and lung irritation, headaches, dizziness, coughing, wheezing, asthma and even death. Children and older people are more sensitive to air pollution and particles from open burning.Check with your local regulations before burning.  These tips and many others can provide you with additional information.  Facts on Open Burning Under Missouri Regulations - PUB2047  What You Can Do to Improve the Air - PUB2199  Turn Off the Engine. Protect Air Quality. Save Gas and Money. Help Reduce Emissions from Idling Vehicles - PUB2354  FuelEconomy.Gov  - Thinking of buying a new vehicle? Visit  fueleconomy.go v to learn more about choosing a more efficient vehicle.The difference between a car that gets 20 MPG and one that gets 30 MPG amounts to $615 per year (assuming 15,000 miles of driving annually and a fuel cost of $2.46).  Conserve Energy - Reduce Air Pollution, Save Money  Perhaps the most notable way that reducing energy helps the environment is by decreasing power plant emissions.When you consume less power, you reduce the amount of toxic fumes released by power plants, conserve the earths natural resources and protect ecosystems. By taking steps to reduce your energy intake, youll contribute to a healthier and happier world.      Maintain your furnace.  Replace your homes air filters regularly.  Use less energy.  Choose efficient appliances and heating systems. Raise your thermostat in the summer and lower in the winter.  Purchase EnergyStar.  Look for the Energy Star label when buying appliances and home or office equipment. Visit energystar.gov to learn more.  Turn the lights off.  Whenleaving the room be sure to turn that switch off.PurchaseLED bulbs.  Air Dry.  Air-dry clothing and linens. Use white vinegar in the rinse cycle, reduce the amount of detergent and fluff briefly in the dryer to decrease stiffness.

sources of air pollution in our homes and neighborhoods. Such sources  vehicles, construction equipment, lawn mowers, dry cleaners, backyard fires, and auto-body shops  are located where we live and work. Total emissions from these smaller but widespread sources are significantly greater than all the industrial sources in the state combined.  To prevent pollution from these sources, the MPCA provides education, guidance, and incentives for reducing air pollution. We have programs for businesses, cities, nonprofits, and communities that address a range of environmental problems, including air quality.  Drive your car less.  Vehicle exhaust is a major source of air pollution in Minnesota. Carpool. Bike. Bus. Telecommute. Electric vehicles. How could you burn less fuel?  Keep your car in good repair.  Fix exhaust and oxygen sensor problems ASAP. Check your tire pressure monthly; under-inflated tires have been shown to lower gas mileage, particularly at lower speed.  Turn off your engine.  An idling engine creates a hot spot of pollution. Buses and big trucks produce particularly unhealthy exhaust. Parents and teachers can help their schools and daycares develop and implement no-idling policies.  Dont burn your garbage.  Burning your household garbage is dangerous to your health and our environment, and generally against the law in Minnesota. If youre still using a burn barrel, wood stove, or fire-pit for your trash, contact your county about arranging for trash hauling services.  Limit backyards fire in the city.  Smoke from backyard fires can cause unhealthy conditions for hundreds of people, especially during stagnant weather conditions. Since cities have elevated levels of pollution compared to rural areas, urban fires are more of a nuisance to people with asthma and other lung conditions. If you do have a campfire:\t Keep fires brief and small    3 feet across or less.  Burn only dry fire wood. In the Twin Cities it is illegal to burn any waste in a fire, even yard waste.  Never start campfires during an  air quality alert . Sign up for texts or emails about elevated air pollution levels.   Plant and care for trees.  Trees filter pollutants and absorb carbon dioxide. Trees also release oxygen into the atmosphere and help cool our homes.  Switch to electric or hand-powered lawn equipment.  Gas-powered engines like those on lawnmowers and leaf or snow blowers often lack pollution control devices. An hour running a lawn mower can produce nearly the same amount of pollution as a 100-mile car trip! Use hand-powered or electric lawn care equipment instead.  Use less energy.  Choose efficient appliances and heating systems. Get an energy audit and follow the advice. Turn off electrical stuff you are not using. It all adds up.  Become a champion for clean air.  Direct local businesses, city offices, and school districts toward programs that can help them reduce air pollution and become more sustainable.\t GreenStep Cities : City and county officials governments can help by passing local ordinances, creating incentives for beneficial behaviors, and promoting and educating residents on best practices.  Small business assistance : The Small Business Environmental Assistance Program helps Minnesota businesses comply with environmental rules, reduce wastes and emissions, and reduce regulatory obligations.  Minnesota GreenCorps :  An AmeriCorps program coordinated by the MPCA places members with organizations around the state to address environmental issues, including air quality.

Air Quality in the Home       AIR QUALITY IN THE HOME   This fact sheet provides answers to basic questions about air quality in thehome. It will explain what causes poor indoor air quality, how it can affectyour health, and what you can do to improve the air quality in your home.  The quality of air in residential buildings has become an important issueto homeowners and health professionals. Indoor air pollution studies haveidentified several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. Theseinclude combustion products, volatile organic compounds (includingformaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilationand elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important inmaintaining good indoor air quality.    WHAT IS INDOOR AIR POLLUTION?  Indoor air pollution is usually caused by the accumulation of contaminantsfrom various sources inside a home. Emissions from fireplaces, stoves,cigarettes, cleaning products, newer building materials, and chemicals storedin the home can cause indoor air problems. People living in this type ofenvironment may experience adverse health effects from breathing thesecontaminants.  Many factors contribute to indoor air pollution. Adding insulation andcaulking to weatherize the home to save on energy costs can reduce aircirculation and trap contaminants inside the home. Outdoor make-upair cannot enter the home and dilute contaminants. This is why healtheffects caused by indoor air pollution are often called tight buildingsyndrome or sick building syndrome.   Many people underestimate the extent of the indoor air pollution problem.Air pollution is usually visualized as the black smoke emitted from factories.Little thought is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays,paints, cleaners, and pesticides used in the home. To compound the problem, itis estimated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of hisor her time indoors, and more than half that time is spent in the home.  WHAT HEALTH EFFECTS CAN BE CAUSED BY POOR INDOOR AIR QUALITY?  Occupants of homes with poor indoor air quality may complain of symptomssuch as headache, eye irritation, fatigue, dry throat, sinus congestion,dizziness, and nausea. Because many illnesses can cause these symptoms,diagnosing sick building syndrome is difficult. Extremely high levels of somecontaminants, such as carbon monoxide, can cause more serious illness,including death.  WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC CAUSES OF POOR INDOOR AIR QUALITY?  Poor ventilation and specific sources of contaminants in the home cause mostindoor air problems. Each of these will be addressed in this section.  1. Ventilation Problems  Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the lack of adequateventilation, which results in a buildup of contaminants from sources in thehome. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identifiedinadequate ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the workplaceindoor air investigations it has conducted. Investigations conducted in homesby the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true.These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is important inmaintaining good indoor air quality.   Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systemsrecirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in homeconstruction is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings inwalls, floors, and roofs. The combination of these construction practices andthe recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems.The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers(ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air perminute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residentialbuildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms inhomes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants andhelps exhaust them from the home.   Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor airquality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regularbasis may become clogged, reducing air flow volume, quality, and distribution.They also may become places for bacteria and molds to grow and be distributedthroughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properlymaintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.   2. Combustion Products  Combustion products from automobile exhaust, furnaces, water heaters, spaceheaters, scented candles, oil lamps, wood stoves, fireplaces, and gas stovesthat are not properly vented can generate carbon monoxide, nitric oxide,nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.These combustion products may result in eye, nose, and throat irritation;fatigue; dizziness; and nausea.   Tobacco smoke is also a combustion by-product that affects indoor airquality. Tobacco smoke contains thousands of different compounds, compoundsincluding carbon monoxide, acrolein, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, andrespirable particles. Acrolein and formaldehyde are potent irritants that causea burning sensation in the eyes.   3. Organic Vapors  Many household products release organic vapors that can cause adverse healtheffects. These effects may include nose and throat irritation, headaches,dizziness, and nausea. Products containing these vapors include paints,strippers, fuels, solvents, pesticides, hobby supplies, cleaners, deodorizers,and disinfectants. Formaldehyde is another organic vapor that can cause similarsymptoms. Formaldehyde can be found in new construction materials, such asplywood, paneling, fiberboard, and particle board, and in cigarette smoke andmany consumer products.  4. Bioaerosols  A bioaerosol is an airborne product of a biological contaminant. Biologicalcontaminants in the home may include mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, andpollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be distributed throughout thehome by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can cause infectious diseases such asLegionnaires disease. They also can cause allergic reactions, includinghypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma.Symptoms caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, eye irritation,coughing, dizziness, and respiratory infections.  Factors that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are wetor moist building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly maintainedhumidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. Humidifier feveris a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that canproduce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi andbacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Duringoperation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and inhaled bythe building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants arepets and household plants.    WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY?  There are many things you can do to improve the indoor air quality of yourhome. These include improving overall ventilation and reducing sources ofcontamination in the home.  1. Improving the Ventilation System  HVAC systems must be properly designed, installed, and maintained to ensuregood operation. The following recommendations may improve the ventilation inyour home:    Follow a regular maintenance schedule for the HVAC system. Regularlyservice the filters and humidifiers.    Install special high efficiency filters in the HVAC system.    Consult with an HVAC contractor to ensure your system is properly designedfor your home.    Use exhaust fans in potential problem areas, such as bathrooms, kitchens,and hobby rooms, to exhaust contaminants generated inside the home.    Residents can supply additional make-up air to the inside of the home byusing mechanical fans when outdoor temperatures are favorable in the spring andautumn. When temperatures are severe during the summer and winter, air-to-airheat exchangers may be installed to supply make-up air. These units exhauststale, warm air from the house and transfer the heat in that air to fresh airbeing supplied from the outside. In air-conditioned houses during the summermonths, heat is transferred from the incoming warm air to the outgoing air,causing a reduction in the energy required for air conditioning.   Homeowners also can install fans that supply outdoor air directly to thereturn side of the HVAC system. These fans are usually installed with a timingmechanism or manual control to regulate the amount of outdoor air supplied tothe structure. This type of system works effectively to supply make-up air, butit also increases the cost of operating the HVAC system since the air is notcooled or heated before it enters the home.  2. Reducing Combustion Products  The following remedies can reduce exposure to combustion products:    Only use space heaters that are vented to the outside.    Install hoods that are vented to the outside above gas stoves.    Inspect furnaces and water heaters regularly to ensure proper operation.    Inspect wood stoves to ensure proper operation. Chimneys should beinspected regularly for soot buildup and other obstructions.    Eliminate or reduce tobacco smoking inside the home.    Refrain from idling or warming up vehicles in garages attachedto homes.    3. Reducing Organic Vapors  The following remedies can reduce exposure to organic vapors:    Use products such as strippers, paints, and hobby supplies that containorganic solvents outside or in a separate room vented directly to the outside.    Store products containing organic solvents in a separate building (shed orgarage) or in a well-ventilated room.    Use products containing organic solvents sparingly and according to labeldirections.    Properly dispose of unused containers of products containing organicsolvents.    4. Reducing Bioaerosols  The following remedies can reduce exposure to bioaerosols:    Install exhaust fans in potential problem areas, such as bathrooms,kitchens, basements, crawlspaces, and attics, to reduce indoor contaminants andmoisture.    Avoid venting clothes dryers to the inside of the home to supplement theheating system. This practice increases moisture inside the home and produces afavorable environment for biological contaminants.    Replace or clean materials in the home that have been water damaged. Usedehumidifiers in moisture-bearing rooms, such as basements, to reduce humidity.Relative humidity should be maintained between 30 percent and 60 percent foroccupant comfort and controlled biological growth.    Use distilled or demineralized water in room humidifiers. Change the waterdaily and do not allow scum and scale to develop. Use a brush or other scrubberto clean the tank while following the manufacturers suggested cleaningmethods. If chlorine bleach or other cleaning products are used, be sure torinse the tank well to avoid breathing harmful chemicals.     WHERE CAN I OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION?
